# MMOS-Reps 

Since the "Reps" or reporting program was first written, it evolved into a multi functional program aimed at staff who act in a supporting capacity.

As well as providing a wide range of reports in several different formats, it also provides aggregated data for finiancial staff. 

Also it provides functionaliy for staff for distribute packages.

Another feature which was added, was to manage duplicate customers, aimed at managers and supervising order entry clerks.

Here's a selection of screenshots from the Reps program.
